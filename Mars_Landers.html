	<h2>The Surface of Mars</h2>
	<p>Landers are the only artifacts of human origin that have
       touched the surface of Mars.  Some have been highly successful,
	   some have spectacularly failed, with the rest falling somewhere
	   in-between.  The following are Landers that have made it to
	   the surface of Mars.</p>

	<section>
	  <p>Viking 1 was the first American spacecraft to successfully
	     land on Mars. It consisted of an orbiter and a lander. The
	     Lander landed on Mars on the Chryse Planitia (Golden Plain)
	     on July 20th of 1976.  Its mission ended on November 13th of
	     1982. Its mission was to perform science experiments (on the
	     native soil), take photos of the area, and gather data on Mars.</p>

	<section>
	  <p>Viking 2 was the second (of a set of two) spacecraft to
         successfully land on Mars. It, like Viking 1, consisted
	     of an orbiter and a lander. The Lander landed on Mars on
	     the Utopia Planitia (Nowhere Land Plain) on September 3rd of 1976.
	     Its mission ended on April 11th of 1980. Its mission, similar
	     to Viking 1, was to perform science experiments (on the
	     native soil), take photos of the area, and gather data on
	     Mars.</p>
