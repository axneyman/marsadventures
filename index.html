	    <h2>Hello Everyone,</h2>
	    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, the next planet furthest out from
	       Earth. It just barely missed being in the Goldilocks zone for our Sun by
	       just a bit.  At one time in its life (after forming from the planetary 
	       debris field), it had temporarily been able to support liquid water.  This
	       is why it is so interesting to us, because who knows what could have
	       happened within that liquid water environment.  This is all possible because
	       the Sun, in its initial span of life, burned hotter and brighter than the
	       Sun we know today, which is good, because it provides the third planet, our
	       Earth, with just the right amount of energy to keep us from freezing solid
	       or boiling all of our water away.</p>

        <h2>From ancient times,</h2>
		<p>The red color (from the iron oxides) of Mars has 
	       spurned on ancient civilizations to associate it as the Roman God of War 
	       (by association with blood and fire).  Nowadays, we look up and see the red
	       color and think of the beautiful barren Martian landscape that our landers
	       and probes have sent back to us.  The probes and landers we have sent 
	       provide us pictures and significant scientific data on the planet, all in
	       order for us to understand it better (the past and present).  Due to the 
	       polar ice caps and identification of ancient waterways (run off), it is 
	       currently the most likely candidate for human visitors in the future.</p>
